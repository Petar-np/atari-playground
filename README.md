Playing with some MOS 6057 assembly code while trying to make games for the Atari 2600 ðŸ˜€

<hr/>

In order to run ```.bin``` files you'll need an Atari 2600 emulator like [Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io/downloads.html) or you can use something like [8bitworkshop IDE](https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.3.0/?=&file=examples%2Fhello&platform=vcs) in your browser without installing anything on your machine.

Installing Stella on **Ubunutu** is easy as running ```sudo apt-get install stella``` inside your terminal
